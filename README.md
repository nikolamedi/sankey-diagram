# sankey-diagram

## About this exercise

In this exercise I wanted to develop a Sankey diagram in Python. Data from the [Tracker of Climate Strategies for Transport](https://www.changing-transport.org/tracker/) has been used. The database has information on transport in Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-term Strategies. As the database assesses how the transport mitigation measures are related to Avoid, Shift and Improve (read about the [Avoid-Shift-Improve framework here](https://www.sutp.org/publications/sustainable-urban-transport-avoid-shift-improve-a-s-i-inua-9/)) among other aspects. So I wanted to see how it can be visualised
